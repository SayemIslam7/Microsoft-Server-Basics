### 2. Can you explain what Active Directory is and its main components?
**Answer**: 
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems. Main components of AD include:
- **Domain**: A logical group of network objects (users, computers) that share the same AD database.
- **Tree**: A collection of one or more domains and domain trees in a contiguous namespace.
- **Forest**: The top-level container of AD that houses multiple trees.
- **Organizational Units (OUs)**: Containers within a domain that can hold users, groups, computers, and other OUs.
- **Group Policy**: A feature for centralized management and configuration of operating systems, applications, and users' settings.

### 3. What is DNS and why is it important in a Windows Server environment?
**Answer**: 
DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses, making it easier for users to access websites and services using human-readable names instead of numerical IP addresses. In a Windows Server environment, DNS is crucial for:
- Resolving domain names within the network.
- Supporting Active Directory functionality by resolving service (SRV) records.
- Ensuring efficient network traffic management.

### 4. Describe the difference between NTFS and ReFS file systems.
**Answer**: 
- **NTFS (New Technology File System)**: The standard file system for Windows, offering features like file encryption, disk quotas, shadow copies, and file permissions.
- **ReFS (Resilient File System)**: Designed for improved data integrity, availability, and scalability. ReFS includes features like automatic integrity checking, data scrubbing, and improved performance for large-scale data applications.

### 5. What is Hyper-V and how is it used?
**Answer**: 
Hyper-V is a virtualization technology developed by Microsoft that allows you to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server. It is used to:
